As soon as you connect to the service through your terminal,
you are given three numbers: p, g, and g^x. They demand x saying:

'Gimme exponent pl0x'
p=12248847.....
g=2
g^x=56359320624......
:(you have to enter x here)

//the value of g^x keeps changing everytime you reconnect to the service

Now as the hint to the problem read 'discrete logarithms are hard', we guess this is a DLP(Discrete logarithm problem).

The discrete logarithm problem is to find the Exponent in the expression:
Base^Exponent = Power (mod Modulus)

Here, our Base is g (here 2), Modulus is p, and Power is g^x value.

You could find x manually (xD) or just use any online DLP Calculator. Eg: https://www.alpertron.com.ar/DILOG.HTM
(Tip: if you get a value like 3360 + 3930 k, we just take the value before the '+' eg. here we would take 3360)

Here the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm is implemented.

Once you get the value of x, you enter it. And boom!
